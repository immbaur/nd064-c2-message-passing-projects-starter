The gRPC interface defines a service called LocationService with a single method "Create", which takes a LocationMessage as input and returns a LocationMessage.

message LocationMessage {
    int32 person_id = 1;
    string creation_time = 2;
    string latitude = 3;
    string longitude = 4;
}

service LocationService {
    rpc Create(LocationMessage) returns (LocationMessage);
}

The inteface can be tested using the the python script in modules/locations-ingestion/app/udaconnect/writer.py
